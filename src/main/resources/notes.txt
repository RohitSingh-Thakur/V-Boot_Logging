in config file if you declare 

<root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="Console" />
        <appender-ref ref="RollingFile" />
    </root>

this at then we will get exception because in logback, you need to define the appenders before referencing them in the root logger.

first create appender lastly refer them
